## Contributing Rules

Contributions are always welcome!

Please read the rules for Pulls and Pushes below

```
1. Please make sure you are pushing to the right branch. There are currently
two main branches:
- Dev [This is for Development and unstable builds]
- Main [This is for Stable builds that are ready to be deployed]

2. Make sure your commits contain useful information and are not stupid shit like "stuff"
When you commit with this information its hard to find what you did. 

3. If pushing to stable be sure to make sure the build is actually stable and-
everything works.
